# WorldID Semaphore Contracts

> These are the underlying contracts that power World ID. If you're looking to integrate with World
> ID, you should use the [Foundry](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-starter) or
> [Hardhat](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-starter-hardhat) starter kits.

This repository contains the underlying contracts that make World ID work, powered by the
[Semaphore library](https://semaphore.pse.dev/). These contracts are responsible for performing
identity operations on chain, and attestation of identities for the purposes of semaphore proofs.
Check out [user-flows.md](./docs/user-flows.md) for more information on how these contracts relate
to the rest of the World ID system.

World ID is a protocol that lets you **prove a human is doing an action only once without revealing
any personal data**. Stop bots, stop abuse.

World ID uses a device called the [Orb](https://worldcoin.org/how-the-launch-works) which takes a
picture of a person's iris to verify they are a unique and alive human. The protocol only requires a
hash-equivalent (i.e. irreversible) of the iris to be stored (which happens on a blockchain). The
protocol uses
[Zero-knowledge proofs](https://docs.worldcoin.org/further-reading/zero-knowledge-proofs) so no
traceable information is ever public.

World ID is meant for on-chain web3 apps, traditional Cloud applications, and even IRL
verifications. Go to the [World ID app](https://worldcoin.org/download-app) to get started.

## Privileged Actions and Trust

The WorldID Identity Manager uses a bifurcated notion of privilege in production. This operates as
follows:

- **Owner:** The owner is responsible for administrating the contract. In production, the contract's
  owner will be a multi-signature wallet.
- **Identity Operator:** The identity operator is responsible for performing identity operations
  using the contract. In production, the contract's identity operator will be a wallet associated
  with [OpenZeppelin Relay](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/defender/relay), ensuring that identities
  are submitted on-chain reliably and in order.

All other contracts use a simple notion of an "owner", that will be held by a multi-signature wallet
in production.

What follows below is a table of privileged operations in the WorldID Identity Manager contract, and
which of the _owner_ and _identity operator_ has the permission to perform these actions.

| Operation                                  | Privileges        | Description                                                                                                                           |
| :----------------------------------------- | :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `acceptOwnership`                          | New Owner         | Accepts the transfer of ownership.                                                                                                    |
| `disableStateBridge`                       | Owner             | Turns off the state bridge.                                                                                                           |
| `enableStateBridge`                        | Owner             | Turns on the state bridge.                                                                                                            |
| `registerIdentities`                       | Identity Operator | Registers new identity commitments into the World ID system.                                                                          |
| `deleteIdentities`                       | Identity Operator | Registers new identity commitments into the World ID system.                                                                          |
| `setIdentityOperator`                      | Owner             | Sets the address that has permission to act as the Identity Operator.                                                                 |
| `setRegisterIdentitiesVerifierLookupTable` | Owner             | Sets the table of verifiers used to verify proofs that correspond to identity insertions.                                             |
| `setDeleteIdentitiesVerifierLookupTable`   | Owner             | Sets the table of verifiers used to verify proofs that correspond to identity insertions.                                             |
| `setRootHistoryExpiry`                     | Owner             | Sets the amount of time it takes for a non-current tree root to expire.                                                               |
| `setSemaphoreVerifier`                     | Owner             | Sets the contract used to verify semaphore proofs.                                                                                    |
| `setStateBridge`                           | Owner             | Sets the address of the state bridge. The state bridge is the contract responsible for sending identity tree updates to other chains. |
| `transferOwnership`                        | Owner             | Transfers ownership from the current owner to a new owner using a two-step process.                                                   |
| `upgradeTo`                                | Owner             | Upgrades the implementation of the identity manager to a new version.                                                                 |
| `upgradeToAndCall`                         | Owner             | Upgrades the implementation of the identity manager to a new version and executes a function call while doing so.                     |

While there have been some discussions pertaining to the implementation of _timelocks_ for sensitive
actions, many of these actions are required for administrating the contracts in conjunction with
external services (such as the [signup sequencer](https://github.com/worldcoin/signup-sequencer)).
To this end, timelocks would cause problems due to delays that could risk desynchronisation between
the contract and external services.

## Development

This repository uses the [Foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) smart contract toolkit. You
can download the Foundry installer by running `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash`, and
then install the latest version by running `foundryup` on a new terminal window (additional
instructions are available [on the Foundry repo](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry#installation)).

We provide a docker image running anvil internally which has all the contracts predeployed.
This approach is the easiest way to get started interacting with the smart contracts.

Simply run
```
> docker run -p 8545:8545 ghcr.io/worldcoin/world-id-contracts
```

This docker image starts an anvil instance with contracts deployed at:
```
WorldIDRouter: 0x59b670e9fA9D0A427751Af201D676719a970857b
WorldIDIdentityManager: 0x68B1D87F95878fE05B998F19b66F4baba5De1aed
```

All the contracts are deployed using the default anvil wallet `0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266`, with the private key `0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80`. This is also the default owner account for all contracts.

### Testing
Tests can be run with `forge test`.

### Deployment

#### contract-deployer

In order to deploy `world-id-contracts` you need to download [`contract-deployer`](https://github.com/worldcoin/contract-deployer), build it and do the following:

1. Download the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/worldcoin/contract-deployer.git
cd contract-deployer
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

2. Setup your environment variables ([link](https://github.com/worldcoin/contract-deployer?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-configuration))

3. Setup deployment config file ([link](https://github.com/worldcoin/contract-deployer?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration-file))

4. Deploy

> [!NOTE]
> You need to have the rust toolchain installed in order to deploy the contracts. [link](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Run:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

#### forge script (new)
A `Deploy.s.sol` deployment script is provided for easy deployment.

To deploy the entire stack (router, orb WorldID, phone WorldID, all the verifiers, etc.) run
```
> export PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>
> export ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=<YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY>
> forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --broadcast --rpc-url <YOUR_RPC_URL> --verify
```
