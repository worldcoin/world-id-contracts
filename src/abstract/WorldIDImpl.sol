    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    // This contract is designed explicitly to operate from behind a proxy contract. As a result,
    // there are a few important implementation considerations:
    //
    // - All updates made after deploying a given version of the implementation should inherit from
    //   the latest version of the implementation. This prevents storage clashes.
    // - All functions that are less access-restricted than `private` should be marked `virtual` in
    //   order to enable the fixing of bugs in the existing interface.
    // - Any function that reads from or modifies state (i.e. is not marked `pure`) must be
    //   annotated with the `onlyProxy` and `onlyInitialized` modifiers. This ensures that it can
    //   only be called when it has access to the data in the proxy, otherwise results are likely to
    //   be nonsensical.
    // - This contract deals with important data for the WorldID system. Ensure that all newly-added
    //   functionality is carefully access controlled using `onlyOwner`, or a more granular access
    //   mechanism.
    // - Do not assign any contract-level variables at the definition site unless they are
    //   `constant`.
    //
    // Additionally, the following notes apply:
    //
    // - Initialisation and ownership management are not protected behind `onlyProxy` intentionally.
    //   This ensures that the contract can safely be disposed of after it is no longer used.
    // - Carefully consider what data recovery options are presented as new functionality is added.
    //   Care must be taken to ensure that a migration plan can exist for cases where upgrades
    //   cannot recover from an issue or vulnerability.
